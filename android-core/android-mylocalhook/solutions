Firstly I'd recommend using an IntentService instead of an AsyncTask.

Secondly, create an inner class in your main activity which extends BroadcastReceiver.

Register an instance of the inner BroadcastReceiver in onResume() of your Activity and unregister it in onPause().

Have your first BroadcastReceiver start the IntentService and have the IntentService send a broadcast which the inner 
BroadcastReceiver of your Activity will be listening for if the Activity is running - the inner BroadcastReceiver can then 
create the progress bar.

When the IntentService finishes what it needs to do get it to send another broadcast to indicate that the progress bar 
should be dismissed.
